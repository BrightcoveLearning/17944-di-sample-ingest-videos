# 17944-di-sample-ingest-videos
In this sample, you will learn how to ingest multiple videos using the Dynamic Ingest API. To get access tokens and make the API calls, it uses a proxy built by Brightcove Learning services.  Note that this sample is for accounts using the legacy ingest system. If your account uses the Dynamic Delivery system, see the Dynamic Delivery version instead.
